The RoomChat plugin lets you define rooms to chat in.

While in a room, all conversations are "local" - ie.
 invisible to all not in the room.

A room is created by placing a sign whose first line
 is "[Room]" and second line is the name of the room.
 Move around a bit until the sign is picked up.

The area of the room is determined automatically by
 searching for a rectangular box around the sign,
 and stopping at areas with less than 70% air.

Rooms are size-limited to 16*16*16.

Room areas are not saved to the disk, but should be
 picked up automatically once you get close to a sign
 after a server restart or plugin reload.

To remove a room, destroy its sign.

Have fun!
